This project tries to recreate the basic functionality of the Tombola Sequencer on the OP-1.

Currently, using this with your synths / DAW will take some configuration. I have only tested on OS X. To use this with your DAW, you will likely need to create an IAC bus (Ableton, which I also happen to use fairly often, has a [tutorial](https://www.ableton.com/en/help/article/using-virtual-MIDI-buses-live/) on how to get started with creating an internal midi bus).

I've created a short [video](https://youtu.be/soI7Zq1B2aY) demoing Laundromat.
