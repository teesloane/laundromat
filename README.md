> Generative midi sequencer inspired by the [OP-1 Tombola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1V3-FbPnnk)

I have wanted to build something with Processing for quite some time. I am also inspired by the OP-1 synthesizer. This project tries to recreate the basic functionality of the Tombola.

Currently, using this with your synths / DAW will take some configuration. I have only tested on OS X. To use this with your DAW, you will likely need to create an IAC bus (Ableton, which I also happen to use fairly often, has a [tutorial](https://www.ableton.com/en/help/article/using-virtual-MIDI-buses-live/) on how to get started with creating an internal midi bus).
